Overview
Fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning, where the goal is to identify fraudulent transactions among legitimate ones. This project explores the process of building a predictive model that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a credit card fraud detection dataset which contains a mix of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a small percentage of fraudulent transactions.

Modeling Techniques
The following steps are performed in the notebook:

Data Exploration: Understanding the data distribution and identifying key features.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features and selecting important ones to improve model performance.
Modeling: Using machine learning algorithms like LightGBM to build and train the fraud detection model.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.11
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
LightGBM
Matplotlib
Seaborn

You can install the required packages using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud-detection-model.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd fraud-detection-model

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook FRAUD DETECTION MODEL.ipynb

Run all cells to execute the code and see the results.

Results
The model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to correctly identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. The results are visualized using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and other relevant plots.
